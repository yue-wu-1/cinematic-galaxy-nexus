### Cinematic Galaxy Nexus - A Movie Search and Recommendation System

## Overview
Cinematic Galaxy Nexus is an interactive movie search and recommendation system that uses a graph-based approach to explore relationships between movies and actors. This web-based tool allows users to:
1.Search for movies by title, genre, or actor.
2.Discover the most influential actors within a specific year range.
3.Find the shortest connection between two actors based on shared movies.
4.Generate movie and actor recommendations with visualized connection graphs.
Note: The system is built using Flask (backend) and JavaScript (frontend), combined with graph-based algorithms via NetworkX for processing relationships between movies and actors.

## Special Instructions
# Required Files:
    1.movies_actors.csv (Dataset containing movie and actor data, extracted from TMDB API.)
        this csv file is already in the project directory. It is created by TMDB_Data_Retrieve.py and it contains movie data from 2015-2024. If you want to explore movie data out of this range, you can modify TMDB_Data_Retrieve.py. (API keys: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJhdWQiOiI1Zjc2NjgzYzZiMzQ2MThlZTVjZTY4ZTU3M2ZlYzc0NyIsIm5iZiI6MTczMjQ4ODAyOS43MjcsInN1YiI6IjY3NDNhYjVkNjg4MjMwMDRjYTljYjJjMiIsInNjb3BlcyI6WyJhcGlfcmVhZCJdLCJ2ZXJzaW9uIjoxfQ.KmOn1hc0C0Q0VGZ8HxPraIeu9f9GvYUAK-MbiekEFK0)

    Note: Ensure movies_actors.csv is placed in the same directory as the project.

Network (Graph) Organization
1. Actor Graph
Nodes: Actors (represented by actor IDs and names).
Edges: Connections between actors who starred in the same movie.
Edge Weights: Calculated based on movie popularity (normalized values).

2. Movie Graph
Nodes: Movies (represented by movie IDs and titles).
Edges: Connections between movies sharing Actors (shared actors) and Genres (common genres).
Edge Weights: Calculated using Jaccard Index based on shared actors and genres

Output Visualizations
Actor and Movie Graphs are dynamically visualized with:
Node colors: Pink (actors), Skyblue (movies)
Edge colors: Skyblue for actors, Pink for movies
